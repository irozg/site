The program is organised by the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Engineering and Informatics of the University of Patras.

The course instructors come mainly from the two collaborating departments plus the following Greek Universities: The National Technical University of Athens, the Hellenic Open University and the Ionian University.

In addition, the University of Patras has signed staff and student mobility agreements with a number of European Universities with strong focus in the area of Human-Computer Interaction.
